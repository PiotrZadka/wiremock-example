# Wiremock example
This repository contain a example of using wiremock with node.js sample API.

Wiremock is a tool to simulate HTTP-based APIs by matching requests and responding with mock data. This is particulary useful when you are developing in environment where 3rd party APIs are not available for testing, however the general structure for request/response is known. This tool can substitute calls to these 3rd party APIs.
